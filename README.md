# LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
The Library Management System (LMS) project is designed to manage and organize information related to a library's resources, employees, customers, and the status of book issues and returns. The project includes a relational database with six tables, each serving a specific purpose in capturing various aspects of the library's operations.
